Test-driven Python library to help deliberate using [Majority Judgment](https://mieuxvoter.fr/).

The goal is to be **scalable**, **reliable**, fast and extensible.
We therefore use a _score-based algorithm_ whatsoever.


## Installation

## Example Usage

Collect the **votes** for each Candidate and provide them in the function `majority_judgment` as is:

```
>>> from majority_judgment import majority_judgment
>>> data = {
...    'Pizza': [0,0,0, 1,1, 2,2, 3,3,3], 
...    'Chips': [0,0, 1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3],
...    'Pasta': [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3],
...    'Bread': [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3],
... }
>>> majority_judgment(data, reverse=False)
{'Chips': 0, 'Pasta': 1, 'Pizza': 2, 'Bread': 3}

```
